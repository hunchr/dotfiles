# Dotfiles

A collection of my personal dotfiles for macOS.

## Setup

Make sure you have [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installed.

Clone this repo and uncomment what you don't need in the `setup.sh` script,
then run it:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/hunchr/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
./setup.sh i
```

> [!CAUTION]
> Running this script will overwrite your current config without any backup.
